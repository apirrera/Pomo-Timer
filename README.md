## 🧱 Usage

The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method that was developed in the late 1980s by Francesco Cirillo. It involves using a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, which is the Italian word for tomato. (Cirillo used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer when practicing this technique as a university student.)

## ⚒️ Contribution

The front-end was completed thus added the React logic and created components for functionality. I set the ability for the addition and subtraction of study and break time.  The minimum time for focus duration is 5 and the minimum for break duration is 1.
